## **1. Overview**

This Take-home Exercise 2 is a critique of a classmate's Take-home Exercise 1 in terms of clarity and aesthetics.

The task for Take-home Exercise 1 is to produce age-sex pyramids in a trellis display to reveal the age group and gender demographic structures of 9 planning areas in Singapore using the "Singapore Residents by Planning Area, Subzone, Age Group, Sex, and Type of Dwelling, June 2022" dataset from the Department of Statistics, Singapore.

The original design was created using Tableau but will now be redone in R Studio, using data visualization principles and best practices learnt so far in the course.

## **2. Getting Started**

Installing (if required) and launching necessary R packages:

```{r}
packages = c("tidyverse", "knitr", "patchwork")
for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```
