    "text": "2.1 Negative Population Growth Rate\nThe age-sex pyramid of all 9 planning areas point towards a negative population growth rate where the large age groups the middle outstrip the younger ones. The adults in these middle age groups will soon become seniors with higher dependency on younger family members for living cost burdens even as general living costs are on the rise. This is consistent with the general discourse on Singapore's aging population problem where the state is also concerned that the burden extends to state funding as well. More resources and facilities in areas such as health care will need to be provided by the government to support the rising number of seniors.\nThis negative growth rate is to a certain extent less prevalent in planning areas such as Bukit Timah, Clementi, and Queenstown where housing prices tend to be higher than the others. This is quite surprising as these are some of the most mature estates in Singapore and would have expected to see a more distinct inverted triangle shape. One possible explanation is that since these areas are home to more affluent families, especially in Bukit Timah, they have the financial muscle to have more children with less concerns about the cost of doing so."
