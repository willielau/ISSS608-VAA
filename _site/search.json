    "text": "2. Age-Sex Pyramid Visualization\nThe proposed age-sex pyramid in a trellis display visualization for the 9 planning areas by gender and age group is available for viewing on Tableau Public.\n\n\n2.1 Negative Population Growth Rate\nThe age-sex pyramid of all 9 planning areas point towards a negative population growth rate where the large age groups the middle outstrip the younger ones. The adults in these middle age groups will soon become seniors with higher dependency on younger family members for living cost burdens even as general living costs are on the rise. This is consistent with the general discourse on Singapore’s aging population problem where the state is also concerned that the burden extends to state funding as well. More resources and facilities in areas such as health care will need to be provided by the government to support the rising number of seniors.\nThis negative growth rate is to a certain extent less prevalent in planning areas such as Bukit Timah, Clementi, and Queenstown where housing prices tend to be higher than the others. This is quite surprising as these are some of the most mature estates in Singapore and would have expected to see a more distinct inverted triangle shape. One possible explanation is that since these areas are home to more affluent families, especially in Bukit Timah, they have the financial muscle to have more children with less concerns about the cost of doing so.\n\n\n2.2 Other Interesting Stray Observations\n\nA hypothesis can be made that females live longer than males as there seems to be more females in the higher age groups in every planning area. This trend starts around the 80-84 age group and becomes most distinct in the 90+ group.\nBelow the 80-84 age group, the ratio of males to females appear to be quite equally split. Furthermore, the largest age groups also appear to be fairly consistent between the number of males and females\nBukit Timah has the smallest total population size but interestingly topped the list at 5,390 transactions between January 2021 and June 2022.\nPasir Ris land area is comparable to Sengkang and Hougang but much less densely populated."

    "text": "2. Critique of Original Design\n\n2.1 Original Design\n\n\n\n2.2 Clarity\nX-Axis Range\nWhen comparing across visual charts, especially ones like age-sex pyramids, people take first impressions base on sweeping visual cues such as comparing the shapes of the pyramid, length of the bars, etc. without looking too much into the details. When the x-axis range is inconsistent like in this case, it will immediately give the wrong interpretations. For example, Ang Mo Kio and Jurong West appears to be similarly shaped and one would interpret that they largely have the same population size. However this is a false interpretation because Ang Mo Kio’s x-axis is scaled to 6,000 while Jurong West is scaled to 10,000.\nThe x-axis is not just inconsistent between the different planning areas but also different within some of the same planning area. For example, Novena has inconsistent range values and also intervals.\nY-Axis Label\nWhile it is quite intuitive to guess that the numbers on the y-axis represents ages since this is called an age-sex pyramid, it would still be good to label it.\nChoice of Planning Area\nThe task required choosing 9 planning areas to visualize but there does not seem to be any rationale or logic for the choices made here.\n\n\n2.3 Aesthetics\nDuplicate Displays\nIt is quite confusing to have duplicate displays of the age-sex pyramids - one in a single row and the other in a 3x3 grid - as people will assume there is a difference. The purpose of this is unclear but it appears from the chart titles (which are also confusing) that the 3x3 grid is supposed to be more detailed than the single row. However it does not really show more detail so since they are exactly the same except they are more spaced out. The single row display is unnecessary.\nThe one positive of the single row display is that at least the x-axis ranges appear to be consistent across all the pyramids."
